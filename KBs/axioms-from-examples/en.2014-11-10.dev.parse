The staff is dedicated, hard working, and generally competent within their areas of specialty. But they are not trained to write a complex code. Nor should they be expected to be. They need proper direction and supervision. Find a person who can provide that direction. Then, work in consort with experienced community members, associations, and trade organizations to develop a code consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.
